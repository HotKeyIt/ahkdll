- fixed MsgSleep to work after termination and reload.
- enabled #Persistent so a script that does not use #Persistent will terminate (use ahkdll ahktextdll or ahkReload to run it again).
- Send commands support inline sleep now when pure digits are specified, like Send a{30}{Tab}b{100}{Enter}. Send {9} will not sleep but send 9.
- Reload, Exit and ExitApp works like they should now for the dll.
- Added 2 new stdlib folder, which is the parent folder of A_AhkPath + Lib.lnk in same folder if it links to a directory.
- - - Directory of A_AhkPath, so now stdlib functions can be placed in same folder for simplicity.
- - - Additionally you can specify a link file in same folder (Lib.lnk) to your stdlib instead of copying the files for a portable project (e.g. on a ram drive!).
- ahktextdll and addScript support loading functions from all 4 libraries now as well.
- AutoHotkey.exe started without parameters checks for following files:
- - 1 %A_AhkPath%\..\[Name of executable].ahk 
- - 2 %A_AhkPath%\..\[Name of executable].ini
- - 3 %A_MyDocuments%\AutoHotkey.ahk
- - - REMINDER: portable mode = copy + rename AutoHotkey.exe to e.g. MyScript.exe and put it together with MyScript.ahk or .ini in same folder.
- No need to call ahkTerminate before calling ahkdll or ahktextdll, it will terminate automatically if a script is running.
- New AhkDll function - AhkDll(dllfile,function,p1,p2...), using static pointers to functions, executes around 5 times faster. 
- - Loads dll library automatically so no need to call DllCall("LoadLibrary"...)
- - Dllfile must contain only characters valid for a variable in ahk [a-zA-Z0-9_#$@]!
- - Functions are all case sensitive!
- ahkgetvar has now a further parameter (UInt), when this parameter is not 0, the pointer of the variable will be returned to use with Alias(), else value is returned

- New AutoHotkeyMini.dll uses a preprocessor and excludes many commands to support much faster load/reload and less memory usage. 
- Following commands are disabled/removed:
- - Hotkey (as well as Hotkey + Hotstring functionality), Gui…, GuiControl[Get], Menu…, TrayIcon, FileInstall, ListVars, ListLines, ListHotkeys, 
- - KeyHistory, SplashImage, SplashText…, Progress, PixelSearch, PixelGetColor, InputBox,
- - FileSelect and FolderSelect dialogs, Input, BlockInput MouseMove[Off], 
- - Build in variables related to Hotkeys and Icons as well as Gui, A_ThisHotkey…, A_IsSuspended, A_Icon….

- ahkReload will reload a script, this can be also done by the script as well as ExitApp.
- ahkPause, get and set Pause state of current thread in dll script (dll only)
- ahkExecuteLine, execute a line by passing its pointer, a pointer is returned by addFile and addScript as well as by this function.
- - when no pointer is given, FirstLine pointer is returned, else pointer to next line is returned.
- changed ahkgetvar to return a value rather than passing a variable, so no need to VarSetCapacity anymore.
- fixed ahkFunction ( now using callFuncDll() ) to continue main script after function call.
- fixed to wait for thread to initialize and return then, as well as when script crashes while initializing.
- addScript will not reset previous script anymore.
- removed const for HotkeyIDType Hotkey so sHotkeyCount can be reset for ahkTerminate.

21.12.2009
- ahkTerminate, after terminating your script you can reload it using ahkdll or ahktextdll.
- script, incl. labels and functions, and hotkey destruction and reload now possible.
- a bug in ahkFunction was fixed.

19.12.2009
- fixed addScript bugs
- created ahktextdll

18.12.2009

- addScript loads script from text, second parameter is to replace current script
 DllCall(A_AhkPath "\addScript","Str","a:`nMsgBox a`nReturn","ushort",1,"Cdecl UInt")

- \ahkdll function will now load text if specified file does not exist

- no need for #Persistent in AutoHotkey.dll 

17.12.2009

- Changed to "Portable Mode"
	- Instead looking for %My_Documents%\AutoHotkey.ahk, the exe checks for %ExeDir%\ExeName.ahk. 
	- So you can copy AutoHotkey.exe and Script to separate folder then rename the exe to ScriptName.exe and start by double clicking the exe. 
	- You can also start new scripts using your exe that way. 
	  e.g. Run YourExe.exe "%filepath%"

- Changed ahkgetvar to support alias and build in variables. 
- Removed ebiv.cpp because ahkgetvar can be used to get any variable beside clipboard and clipboardall 
- Changed ahkFunction to support up to 10 parameters + return values
